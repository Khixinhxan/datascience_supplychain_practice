Notation of the queue model
The tow main inputs for any queue system are:
     ^ (Lambda): average number of arrivals per time period
     M (MU): average number of customers served per time period

The standard notation system to classify a queueing system is A/B/C/K/M, where
    A: represents the probability distribution for the arrival process
    B: represents the probability distribution for the service process
    C: represents the number of channels (service)
    K: represents the maximum number of customer allowed in the queueing system
    M: represents the maximum number of customers in total

Commom option for a and b 

M for a poission arrival distribution (Thus, exponential inter-arrival distribution)
or an exponential service time distribution
    D for A deterministic of constant value
    EK for an erlang distribution of order K
    G for A general distribution with known mean and variance


Parametes we look for 

RO (P): overall system utilization
PO: the probability that all servers are idle
LQ: long-run average number of customer in the queue 
WQ: long-run average time spent in the queue
X: system throughput
L: long-run average number of customer in the system
W: long-run average time spent in the system
WQQ: long-run average time spent in queue when there is queue in a queueing model
LQQ: long-run average number of customers in queue when there is queue in a queueing model
